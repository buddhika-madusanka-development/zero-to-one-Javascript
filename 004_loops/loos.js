// What are loops?
// Loops repeat a block of code until a condition is met—perfect for automation!

// For Loop?
// Runs a block of code a fixed number of times: for (start; condition; step) { ... }!

// While Loop?
// Keeps running as long as the condition is true: while (condition) { ... }!

// Do-While Loop?
// Runs at least once, then checks the condition: do { ... } while (condition);

// For-In Loop
// Loops through the properties of an object: for (let key in obj) { console.log(obj[key]); }

// For-Of Loop
// Loops through iterable values like arrays: for (let item of arr) { console.log(item); }

// ForEach Loop?
// A method for looping through arrays: arr.forEach(item => console.log(item));—simpler than for!

// Break & Continue?
// break exits a loop early, continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next!
